# Tic-Tac-Toe

Most of this code is derived from a tutorial I followed along, as the Javascript for this game was a bit complicated for me. I learned some interesting things like:

use of the "once : true" method in event listeners, designing characters using transform in CSS and not relying on fonts, iterating through the every method in javascript to search for win or lose patterns in simple games like this, and using psuedo elements "::before" and "::after" to implement certain hover effects through CSS

Update 1: Added a winning combination that was missing, and added text that show's whose turn it is
