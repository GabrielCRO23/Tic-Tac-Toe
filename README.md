# Tic-Tac-Toe

The CSS styling of this project is from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM

Designing characters using transform in CSS and not relying on fonts is a very cool feature. 

Update 1: Added a winning combination that was missing, and added text that show's whose turn it is

Update 2: Added AI that plays against itself

Current issue to fix: If user clicks "reset button" too quickly before the setTimeout task loop is over, the remaining loops will spill over onto the next cleared board. Still looking for a way to break that loop without rewriting the checkWin function.

Will add: Local storage keys and score tracker
